# Landing Page Project

This is a simple dynamic landing page project and responsive 
it works at any web browser 
you can add new sections as much as you want
It will add new navbar links to it automatically 
I created it using HTML,CSS,JavaScript
 
I used java script to create the navbar dynamic way and I added scroll to view option 
and when the section and navbar link is active it changes their color
and there is a go to top bottun to go to top view.
Thank you and have a nice day.
